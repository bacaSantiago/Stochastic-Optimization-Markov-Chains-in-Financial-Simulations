# Stochastic Optimization: Markov Chains in Financial Simulations

---

## Overview

This project delves into using Markov chain theory in a financial market context, simulating the price movements of a financial asset through a discrete-time Markov process. By leveraging the probabilistic framework of Markov chains, the model analyzes the likely outcomes of different investment strategies, capturing metrics like profit, stop-loss limits, and waiting times between investment events. The main goal is to simulate these outcomes under varying initial setups to assess potential profitability and investment strategy risk.

## Project Structure

The simulation models price changes as a series of discrete states centered around a mean price level ($\bar{S}$), with allowable variations up to four increments above or below the mean. Transition probabilities, defined in a matrix format, represent the likelihood of moving between these price states, enabling realistic market path simulations over a specified horizon.

### Key Sections

1. **Initialization**: Definition of core variables, such as the mean price, incremental step size, and simulation horizon, establishing the asset’s fluctuation range and setting the baseline for analysis.
2. **Markov Chain Simulation**: The Markov chain sequences are generated using the transition probability matrix, providing simulated trajectories of price states.
3. **Threshold Analysis**: Implementations to determine if and when price reaches Take-Profit (TP) or Stop-Loss (SL) levels, identifying moments of potential reinvestment.
4. **Empirical and Theoretical Probabilities**: Probability calculations for reaching TP or SL, with theoretical estimations derived from linear systems of equations based on the Markov chain’s structure.
5. **Long-Term Strategy Analysis**: Modeling a repeated investment process with continuous reinvestments, providing insights into expected returns and reinvestment frequencies under different initial conditions.

### Variable Definitions

- **$\bar{S}$**: Mean price around which the asset fluctuates.
- **$\Delta S$**: Price increment defining the gap between price states.
- **$\eta$**: Initial state distribution for simulations.
- **$N$**: Total simulation steps representing the investment horizon.
- **SL (Stop-Loss)**: Price threshold two steps below $\bar{S}$, triggering a sell to avoid further loss.
- **TP (Take-Profit)**: Price threshold three steps above $\bar{S}$, marking profitable exits.
- **Transition Matrix $(P_i)$**: Probability matrix defining possible price state transitions.

### Model Details

- **State Representation**: The Markov chain states represent the asset price as a discrete range around $\bar{S}$.
- **Transition Probabilities**: Probabilities in matrix form specify movement likelihoods between states, allowing price paths to mirror market behavior.
- **Threshold-Based Actions**: Defined TP and SL thresholds simulate realistic investment exits, reflecting profitability and risk controls.

## Theoretical Insights and Approach

### Markov Chain Theory in Finance

The model employs Markov chain theory for probabilistic forecasting, particularly useful in assessing scenarios where state-based transitions (i.e., price fluctuations) influence outcomes. We employ **hitting probabilities** and **expected stopping times**, solving linear systems to predict the probability and timing of hitting predefined thresholds.

### Simulation Mechanics

Monte Carlo simulations estimate long-term outcomes, with repeated investments modeled by resetting after each TP or SL event. This approach uncovers return distributions and reinvestment frequency patterns under stochastic conditions, offering insights into the feasibility of continuous reinvestment strategies in volatile markets.

### Empirical and Theoretical Analysis

To validate the model, empirical simulations are compared to theoretical calculations based on the **Convergence Theorem** and **First-Step Analysis**. The close alignment of these results demonstrates the robustness of Markov processes in financial modeling.

- **Multi-Asset Portfolios**: Simulate the combined effects of Markovian dynamics across multiple assets.
- **Variable State-Transition Matrices**: Reflect changing market conditions and adaptive investment thresholds.
- **Risk-Adjusted Metrics**: Incorporate measures like Sharpe Ratio to balance return expectations with risk.
